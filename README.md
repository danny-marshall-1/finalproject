## notes about the project:
### the project was initially supposed to be a mobile app but we switched gears to a renpy visual novel.
### the main challenge of this project was coming up with a creative script that accounts for all the different branching points where decisions are made.
### the renpy syntax was also challenging at times, as I worked through many errors at first not realizing that the way renpy handles variables and statements is a little different.
### adding images also took some work, as each image needed to be a certain size in order to display properly in the window.
### otherwise, the coding itself was fairly straightforward. The visual novel we made was fairly basic so it didn't require much in the way of complicated Python.
### a lot of hours were put into this project, and I think the end result wasn't necessarily everything I could have dreamed of, but I'm quite satisfied with it.
